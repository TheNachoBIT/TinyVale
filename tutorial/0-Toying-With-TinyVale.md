# Toying with TinyVale

Hello and welcome to this tini-tiny book/tutorial/whatever called "Toying with TinyVale"! Where you're going to learn how the compiler works, and how you can implement features, bugfixes and more!

This book is also for people that are **just getting started with compiler developement**, so if you're interested in toying with the language, or maybe in the future, contribute to it, this is the right place for you! :D

Despite this being a beginners guide, it is recommended to already have atleast **some experience with programming atleast in one language**. Although this book will try its best to explain it without assuming what kind of knowledge you already have.

# TinyVale

An attempt to make [**Vale's Compiler**](https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale) more tiny and easy to work with, and also by adding some of the technical quirks from a programming language i've been working for a while called [**Mascal**](https://github.com/mascal-lang/mascal).

At the same time, i'm going to be documenting each step of this compiler to make sure everyone understands the internals of it, and hopefully it'll be easier for people to contribute.
